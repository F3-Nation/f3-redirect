# Run unit tests with coverage and enforce a minimum threshold on the
# business-logic packages.
#
# The cloud-IO packages (internal/certstore, internal/server) and the cmd/
# entrypoints talk to live GCS / ACME / sockets and are validated by the
# deploy-time smoke test, not unit coverage — so they are intentionally
# excluded from the gate to keep the threshold meaningful.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/coverage.sh                 # enforce default threshold
#   COVER_THRESHOLD=80 scripts/coverage.sh
#   COVER_PKGS="./internal/mappings/..." scripts/coverage.sh
